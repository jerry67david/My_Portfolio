    <h2>Hi, I'm Jerry David</h2>
    <p>A Computer Science Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in Java development and a deep interest in backend technologies and software engineering principles. My academic and personal 
learning journey has been reinforced by solving 
problems on LeetCode, with a focus on data 
structures, algorithms, and dynamic 
programming.
 My goal is to pursue a career as a Java 
Backend Developer, where I can contribute to 
scalable system design and performance
driven solutions.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I specialize in ObjectOriented Programming (OOPs) and have handson experience building Java-based applications using tools and frameworks such as the Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and MySQL for database management. I have built and contributed to projects like a Flight Ticket Booking System and a TaxiCab Booking System, applying concepts like modular design, encapsulation, and real-time data handling.</p>

      <h3>Taxi Cab Booking System</h3>
      <p>A console-based Java application simulating a taxi booking system with 
dynamic allocation based on availability, distance, and earnings.
 Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming OOP principles, applying 
classes and encapsulation to efficiently manage taxis, bookings, and 
fare calculations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Calculator using Java OPP's Concept</h3>
      <p>Developed a modular calculator application in Java that performs 
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and modulus. Implemented core Object-Oriented Programming 
OOP concepts including encapsulation, abstraction, and 
polymorphism. Used separate classes for each operation to ensure 
modular, scalable, and maintainable code architecture. Applied Java 
fundamentals such as class inheritance, method overriding, and clean 
interface-driven development</p>
